# Pokémon Emerald

My enhancement hack.

Uses [Pokeemerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) as a base, which modernizes the game and adds many features. Some of these are:
- Upgraded battle engine
- Better AI
- Fairy type, Physical/Special split
- Pokémon species and moves from newer Generations
- Items from newer Generations and updated item effects
- Lots more!
