# Pokémon Emerald Monotype

This enhancement hack locks you into a single type at the beginning of the game. Professor Birch will ask you what your favorite type is, and from then on, all wild Pokémon will be that type. 

Uses a custom system to generate wild Pokémon. Any nonlegendary, unevolved Pokémon of your chosen type can appear in the wild. All eligible Pokémon are equally likely to appear. This means you can (rarely) see starters from any generation if you pick Grass, Fire, or Water.

Uses [Pokeemerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) as a base, which modernizes the game and adds many features. Some of these are:
- Upgraded battle engine
- Better AI
- Fairy type, Physical/Special split
- Pokémon species and moves from newer generations
- Items from newer generations and updated item effects

This hack also includes some other small enhancements, such as turbo-speed text.
